# Team-Profile-Generator-

This is a webpage app that allows the user to create a Team Profile, after inputing data into the prompts. The user inputs how many people are on their team, what role they are, their ID numbers, phone numbers, github accounts and much more. 

## Description

The Team Profile Generator, is a webpage that was designed from scratch. I had to use my understanding of javascript, node.js and much more to build a node.js application which allows the user to input information into the node index.js terminal, and output the information into a professionally designed Team profile generator. 

## Tasks Completed 

1. Created basic file from Github with a README.md, license and initial index.js file. 
2. Created initial files needed for this project, and folders for organization. 
3. Moved test files into test folder, individual employee files, into the lib file and index.html and style.css files into Assets folder for increased organization. 
4. Initialized and ran npm to allow project to run in terminal.
5. Created .gitignore file, to ignore certain files like node_modules, which aren't necessary for pushing to github. 
6. Made question sheets in index.js file, which prompt in the terminal when running the program. 

    example:                 
                
                message: "What is your Interns name?",
                name: "name",
                type: "input",
7. Made section in index.js file, which prompts creation of the index.html file, when the user answers the questions prompted onto the terminal, after the user selects the option for "im done adding members" the information will prompt to the index.html page. 
8. Made template for the index.html file to follow, and used CSS file to style the page in a basic manner. 
9. Tested employee.test files to make sure they pass all criteria within the prompt terminal. 
10. Made sure all programs interact as they are intended to. 
11. Made sure the file looked of professional quality, and uploaded it to Github. 

## Installation

1. Download files from the repository. 
2. Open index.js and a command terminal for the folder. 
3. Initialize npm within file terminal. 
4. Within terminal, type in node index.js and answer questions within prompts.
